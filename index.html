                <p> In 2021 I took a class in 3D engine technology and made a "Roll a ball" clone with a friend.The goal is to manouver the ball through the levels and collect as much stars as possible.Players are not only challenged by the level itself, there are many other threats like aggressive turtles, shooting turrets and lava patches on the ground. </p>

                <p> Together with some friends, I sometimes participate in Game Jams. As team barely finished games, we developed several small games, which we published on our itch.io page and our GitHub. </p>
