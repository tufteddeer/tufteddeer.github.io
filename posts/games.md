# Games

Together with some friends, I sometimes participate in Game Jams. As team _barely finished games_, we developed several small games, which we published on our [itch.io](https://barely-finished-games.itch.io) page and our [GitHub](https://github.com/BarelyFinishedGames).

## The Sea is Water

## Slimecaves

We made Slimecaves during the 7 day Roguelike jam in 2021. It is the first game we made in more than 48 hours and the extra time allowed us to improve our project management, git and general development workflow.

In Slimecaves, players move through rooms they create dynamically by breaking walls. They can fight slimes and improve their attributes by finding and equipping items.

As always, my focus was on writing code. Besides other things, I implemented the attribute and status effect system for the player character, which laid the ground works for potions as well as the equipping of items I developed on top of it.

Slimecaves was built using Godot with C# as scripting language.
