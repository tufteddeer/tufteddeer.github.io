# Games

Together with some friends, I sometimes participate in Game Jams. As team _barely finished games_, we developed several small games, which we published on our [itch.io](https://barely-finished-games.itch.io) page and our [GitHub](https://github.com/BarelyFinishedGames).


## Slimecaves

We made Slimecaves during the 7 day Roguelike jam in 2021. It is the first game we made in more than 48 hours and the extra time allowed us to improve our project management, git and general development workflow.

In Slimecaves, players move through rooms they create dynamically by breaking walls. They can fight slimes and improve their attributes by finding and equipping items.

As always, my focus was on writing code. Besides other things, I implemented the attribute and status effect system for the player character, which laid the ground works for potions as well as the equipping of items I developed on top of it.

Slimecaves was built using Godot with C# as scripting language.

## Kintsugi

The first game we made as a team back in 2020. Two years and four games later, I still think it is the best game we created. The art and sound create a fantastic atmosphere, which is further enhanced by the satisfying visual effects when one of the cracks is filled (sadly, the particles are not available in the browser version). I am really proud to be responsible for the generation of cracks and their visuals, as well as the ambient lights, which change in different areas of the level. There is also an android port available I made some time after the jam, it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tufteddeer/kintsugi/releases/tag/v0.1_android).

We made Kintsugi using the Godot Engine.

## Es zieht!

In late 2020, we developed our second game during another 48 hour jam. The theme was _lüften_ (german for opening the window). Of course, as soon as somebody mentions _lüften_, some other person notices the slightest amount of air being moved through the room, followed by the traditional testimony <q>Es zieht</q>. We immediately had the urge of making a game where the player moves through an office and solves puzzles by opening or closing windows, thus controlling the airflow.

Among other things, I implemented the camera system that moves the camera between different areas and the level transitions, which where used to build the level. I also had a part in developing core gameplay mechanics, involving air streams and boxes.

_Es zieht_ was made using the Godot Engine.

Made with Unity

## Shorthorn

Our interpretation of the _lost and found_ theme at Global Game Jam 2021 resulted in some kind of desktop simulator, where the player has to navigate through the machines directory structure to recover from a cyber attack.

Oh and there are cat pictures!

We made shorthorn using phaser.js.
